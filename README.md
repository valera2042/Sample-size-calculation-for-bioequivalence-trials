# Sample size calculation (using multiple previoud studies) for bioequivalence trials
This script aims to compute the sample size for the bioequivalence trials from pivotal bioequivalence trials.
The calculation takes into account the design, the coefficient of variation (CV) and the number of subjects.
The computation can be based not only single trial, but on a multiple previous studies.
# Description
Once selecting the sample size for the conduction of the clinical bioequivalence trial it is mandatory to conduct the Public Assessment Reports (PAR) review. The sample size calculation is typically based on pharmakokinetic parameters such as Cmax, AUC, etc. There is a natural variation from study to study of the CV, the number of subjects etc. Typically there are multiple previous studies, and the problem is what study to choose for the calculation of the sample size?
