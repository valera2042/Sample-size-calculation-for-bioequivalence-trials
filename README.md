# Sample-size-calculation-for-bioequivalence-trials
This script aims to compute the sample size for the bioequivalence trials from pivotal bioequivalence trials.
The calculation takes into account the design, the coefficient of variation (CV) and the number of subjects.
The computation can be based not only single trial, but only a multiple previous studies
